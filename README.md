# Features:

**User Preferences:**

* Users are typically presented with a user-friendly interface where they can specify their password preferences. Common preferences include password length, the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Randomization::**

* JavaScript uses a randomization algorithm to generate passwords based on the user's preferences. It selects characters from the specified character sets (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) to create a password that meets the desired length.

**Display:**

* Once the password is generated, it is displayed to the user on the web page. This allows users to easily copy and paste the password into their account registration or password change forms.

**Clipboard Integration:**

* To enhance usability, some password generators offer a "Copy to Clipboard" button that allows users to copy the generated password with a single click, making it convenient for them to use the password immediately.

**Responsive Design:**

* The generator's user interface is often designed to be responsive, ensuring that it functions well on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.
